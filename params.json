  "body": "### About The Project\r\nI started this project because I wanted to challenge myself by coming up with something that would give a final product that was useful for me. The premise of the project is that reading your essay papers backwards (sentence by sentence) helps one catch mistakes in one's writing therefore making the editing process of essay papers easier. The student is able to focus on making each sentence can stand on its own.\r\n\r\n### Project Requirements\r\nThe requirements for this project:\r\n* The user can enter or paste text on the text box.\r\n* The text box must accept more than one paragraph.\r\n* The program must reverse the text that the user enters, reverse the sentences in the paragraph not each word.\r\n* The user must be able to copy the reversed text, to be able to paste it onto something else.\r\n\r\n### What I learned\r\nThis project taught me how to use my creativity to create something from scratch by building an application that was useful to me as a final product. I wanted to challenge myself to create something which I could use in the future during my studies at Sacramento State.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nOmar Enriquez\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n* Phone: 949.205.3984\r\n* Email: omarenriquez11@gmail.com\r\n* LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/omarenriquez",
